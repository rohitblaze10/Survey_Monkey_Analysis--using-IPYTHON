# SurveyMonkey Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes survey data collected via SurveyMonkey to extract key insights and trends. The dataset is processed using Python, and visualizations are created to present meaningful findings. The final results are compiled into a presentation.

## Project Structure
- **Data - Survey Monkey Output.xlsx**: Raw survey data exported from SurveyMonkey.
- **Script1-Data_manipulation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and analysis.
- **Final_Presentation.xlsx**: Summary of key insights and visualizations.
